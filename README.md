- 👋 Hi, I’m @vatavasi
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code, contrinute to open source, and ***finally help myself live a life I like!***
- 🌱 I’m calways learning something ... it could be `git, python and haskell` or `data privacy, cryptography or risk management`, as well as trying to figure out how I can improve my brain's logic. While continuous learning is my good side, not mastering any one subject is the other side. Notice I am not calling that side `bad`. Not necessarily. I have my reasons.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any little stuff to begin with, it can be as simple as just writing `readme.md` files (I love **Markdown**!)
- 📫 How to reach me ... write to me surab@gmx.com
