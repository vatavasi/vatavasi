- 👋 Hi, I’m @vatavasi
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code, contrinute to open source, and ***finally help myself live a life I like!***
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... `git, python and haskell`, as well as trying to figure out how I can improve my brain's logic.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any little stuff to begin with, it can be as simple as just writing `readme.md` files (I love **Markdown**!)
- 📫 How to reach me ... write to me surab@gmx.com
